The engine is written is C++ and is designed to be extensible so you can easily add your own data types to be used in scripts and also
your own C functions that can be called from script. So you can implement functions that can be called from agent scripts to create and manipluate Parts within an agent. 
These types and functions are placed in user defined C++ modules which can be registered for use with God and Worlds. Modules also have an update interface allowing for
specific C++ code to be run for the module when God or the World they are registered with updates.
To see an example of how to implement a module look at the demonstration VectorModule in the Code/DemoApp/ directory.<br><br>
To use the shhArc API include the header file Code/Arc/Api.h
